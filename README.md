# Joplin Plugin Bundle

Plugins with panels. Some of the plugins come from other repo, and I modified it to show all the plugin panels in the same panel under different tabs.

Current plugins:

* Outline (v1.3.1): https://github.com/cqroot/joplin-outline

## Building the plugin

The plugin is built using Webpack, which creates the compiled code in `/dist`. A JPL archive will also be created at the root, which can use to distribute the plugin.

To build the plugin, simply run `npm run dist`.

The project is setup to use TypeScript, although you can change the configuration to use plain JavaScript.

## Updating the plugin framework

To update the plugin framework, run `npm run update`.

In general this command tries to do the right thing - in particular it's going to merge the changes in package.json and .gitignore instead of overwriting. It will also leave "/src" as well as README.md untouched.

The file that may cause problem is "webpack.config.js" because it's going to be overwritten. For that reason, if you want to change it, consider creating a separate JavaScript file and include it in webpack.config.js. That way, when you update, you only have to restore the line that include your file.
